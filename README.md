2048 is a single-player sliding-tile puzzle game. The goal is to combine numbered tiles on a 4Ã—4 grid to create a tile with the number 2048. Players use arrow keys (or swipe on touch devices) to slide all tiles; when two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with their sum. The game ends when the player reaches 2048 (win) or no legal moves remain (game over).

Key aspects:

HTML5 & CSS3 for structure and styling, with responsive layout.

Vanilla JavaScript handles game logic, event handling (keyboard & touch), animations, and state persistence (via LocalStorage).

Modular code separated into grid management, tile merging logic, input handling, and UI updates.

High replay value through randomized tile spawns and score tracking
